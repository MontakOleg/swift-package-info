# Swift Package Info
CLI tool that provides information about a *given Swift Package product*, such as a *measurament of its binary size impact*.
It's built on top of [Swift Argument Parser](https://github.com/apple/swift-argument-parser).

## Usage
```
OVERVIEW: A tool for analyzing Swift Packages

Provides valuable information about a given Swift Package,
that can be used in your favor when deciding whether to
adopt or not a Swift Package as a dependency on your app.

USAGE: swift-package-info <subcommand>

OPTIONS:
  --version               Show the version.
  -h, --help              Show help information.

SUBCOMMANDS:
  binary-size             Estimated binary size of a Swift Package product.
  platforms               Shows platforms supported b a Package product.
  dependencies            List dependencies of a Package product.
  full-analyzes (default) All available information about a Swift Package product.

  See 'swift-package-info help <subcommand>' for detailed help.
```

> swift run swift-package-info help binary-size
```
OVERVIEW: Estimated binary size of a Swift Package product.

Measures the estimated binary size impact of a Swift Package product,
such as "ArgumentParser" declared on `swift-argument-parser`.

* Note: The estimated size doesn't consider optimizations such as app thinning.
Its methodology is inspired by [cocoapods-size](https://github.com/google/cocoapods-size),
and thus works by comparing archives with no bitcode and ARM64 arch.
Such a strategy has proven to be very consistent with the size added to iOS apps downloaded and installed via TestFlight.

USAGE: swift-package-info binary-size --repository-url <repository-url> [--package-version <package-version>] --product <product> [--verbose]

OPTIONS:
  --repository-url, --for, --package, --repo-url, --url <repository-url>
                          URL containing the Swift Package / `Package.swift` that contains the product you want to run analyzes for. 
  -v, --package-version <package-version>
                          Semantic version of the Swift Package. If not passed in the latest release is used. 
  --product, --product-named, --product-name <product>
                          Name of the product to be checked. 
  --verbose               Increase verbosity of informational output 
  --version               Show the version.
  -h, --help              Show help information.
```
